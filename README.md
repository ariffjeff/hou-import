# hou-import
Allows access of the `hou` module from a Regular Python Shell.

This file does some preliminary setup every time its called to allow [this function](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/hom/commandline.html) to work correctly.

You will probably need to make some minor changes to the file in general to fit your needs.

The only dependency you'll need to install is win32api.
